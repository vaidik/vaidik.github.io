                &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vaidik/incoming&#34;&gt;Incoming&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; validation framework for Python. Validation of payloads
sent over &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; requests has always been a mess. A bunch of if-then-else
further branching into more if-then-else blocks is common and over time
becomes extremely difficult to manage. Since the use of &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt;
for &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;HTTP&lt;/span&gt; payload is a common practice, it only made sense to solve the
problem of payload validation for payloads in &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; format. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/vaidik/incoming&#34;&gt;Incoming&lt;/a&gt; is an opinionated
&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; validation framework which does not bind to any kind of web frameworks.
It just tries to make &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;JSON&lt;/span&gt; validation sensible and logical by giving it
structure and making it possible to re-use validation code across your&amp;nbsp;application.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                &lt;p&gt;I wrote this article while I was doing my undergrad for students who I was
guiding while mentoring in Sytems and Network Programming lab course work. Every
lab course would have a semester end assignment (or what we would call semester
projects). Cloud Computing was one of the areas in which students could do their
projects. But without any understanding of the area, students would decide to
make their projects under Cloud Computing and end up doing things that were not
even closely related to the area. Unfortunately, there was not much help from
the faculty as well. This article was an attempt to explain the topic/area to
the students of the lab that I was&amp;nbsp;assisting.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

the only mobile device that I used to use was my Apple iPad 2. In fact, I
still use it. Besides various things that I do on my phone, I also want to
easily keep a track of my spending. Being a college student, that is important
for me. However during the little time I have spent with my mobile devices, I
have only realized that there isn&amp;#8217;t a &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; app good enough that has been
able to catch my attention and fulfill my basic&amp;nbsp;needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note&lt;/strong&gt;: I am not talking about an app for wealth management. I don&amp;#8217;t
have much knowledge about it and I don&amp;#8217;t know what goes in&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

It has a very simple &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;
and is motivated by my understanding and experience of using existing frameworks
like Django, Flask, Drupal and some other pieces of code I have read in the past.
Though I have written this code for my personal use, its free for anyone to use.
The idea behind writing &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/vaidikkp/marg&#34;&gt;Marg&lt;/a&gt; was to have a boilerplate code for myself which I can
use for my own&amp;nbsp;projects.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

Given that not a lot of good events/conferences for geeks happen here in Delhi/&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;NCR&lt;/span&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://us.pycon.org/2012/&#34;&gt;PyCon &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;US&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://denver2012.drupal.org/&#34;&gt;DrupalCon Denver&lt;/a&gt; were the last two conferences that I attended earlier this
year in March, I was getting impatient to attend another conference and get together with
some geeks. I like it because there is lots to learn from the sessions and the smart people 
who attend these events, and its always fun to know how busy the people you know are
innovating new and awesome&amp;nbsp;stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all, I&amp;#8217;d like to thank the &lt;a href=&#34;http://in.pycon.org/2012/&#34;&gt;PyCon India&lt;/a&gt; organizing team for the amazing hard work
they had put in. PyCon is a completely volunteer driven effort and wouldn&amp;#8217;t have been
possible without the hard work put in by all the involved&amp;nbsp;volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

that is how I have been contributing so far. Yes, I have organized some events in my college which, unfortunately, I did not publicise enough in the community either 
prior or post events. But these events were really successful. With the help of some other volunteers in my college, I was able to really convert a couple of guys into
code contributors. The output of these events was amazing. One day, I just applied to become a &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReMo&#34;&gt;Mozilla Rep&lt;/a&gt;. And guess what, I became one. My mentor is &lt;a href=&#34;http://fuzzyfox.mozhunt.com/&#34;&gt;FuzzyFox&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;PasswordProtect is a firefox extension that helps you with keeping your different accounts on the web safe by generating different secure passwords for your accounts. And the best part – you may choose to remember just one password for logging&amp;nbsp;in!&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;JIIT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;OSDC&lt;/span&gt; hadn&amp;#8217;t organized an event since a very long time. So the members really wanted to do something new. Around this time, Firefox 4 was also launched. So, the members decided to celebrate the launch of Firefox 4 in the college. We were not the only ones doing this. Communities from all over the world were going to have a launch party as Mozilla openly invited anyone to go ahead and celebrate the launch of Firefox 4 in their community or organization. Therefore, our event became an official event of Mozilla. It also became our college&amp;#8217;s (&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;JIIT&lt;/span&gt;) official event as the Computer Science department was positive about it and was ready to&amp;nbsp;support.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

&lt;p&gt;Somehow most of the fun and interesting things that have happened and are happening with me have happened because of OSSCamp at &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;JIIT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;NOIDA&lt;/span&gt;, India. That last meeting during OSSCamp has changed everything about me as to what I was before I attended&amp;nbsp;OSSCamp.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>
