                    <a href="">Google Summer of Code 2012</a>
                </h2>
                <p>Introduction to Google Summer of Code program and what a student needs to do
to apply and get selected in the program. This article is an attempt to create
a guide for the program out of the personal experiences I have had with the&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>For those of you who don&#8217;t know what GSoC is, it is a program (like an
internship and you have to work from home) in which you get to work on a
project for another existing open-source project. For example, you may work
on a project that is about improving some part of Mozilla Firefox or you
may work on something like writing a library for OpenCV or you get to work
on a MediaWiki plugin. The projects that get get selected for Google Summer
of Code are very very good projects and if you get to work on them, you get
to learn a lot. You get to learn about best programming practices, how to
work in an open-source community, version controlling, development
procedures, etc. You will also be assigned a mentor who will guide you
through your project and review your work. GSoC is for 3 months. You can
work from anywhere in the world. And, the best part is that you get paid.
Last year it was $5000, which is a lot of&nbsp;money.</p>
<p>Apart from all that, you get to know good people in your field and you
learn a lot. These people may become your potential employers in the&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>The idea behind GSoC is to get more contributors for open-source projects.
So ideally, once you are done with GSoC, it is your responsibility to
continue to work on your code and improve it or provide patches for bugs
when necessary. Ideally, you should also get involved deeply with the
open-source project you will get to work&nbsp;for.</p>
<p>So if you didn&#8217;t know about GSoC, find out more and try to get in. There
cannot be a better way to get involved in an open-souce project. And hey,
you get paid for a good cause!&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>For more details, visit this <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/.">link</a>.</p>
<h3>The&nbsp;Procedure</h3>
<p>Getting selected in GSoC is no easy task. It is a long process and in a
way, it begins&nbsp;now.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Your marks <span class="caps">DON</span>&#8217;T <span class="caps">MATTER</span>. Yes! It is not an issue for them if you
    have a back or if you are 9 pointer. You can contribute and be a&nbsp;GSoCer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select an organisation/project you want to work for. For example:
    MediaWiki (the software that powers Wikipedia), OpenCV, Wordpress, Drupal,
    Mozilla, Fedora, etc. There are more than a hundred organisations that
    participate. Read further on how to select your&nbsp;organisation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get involved with the community. Start contributing now and don&#8217;t&nbsp;wait.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Talk to people on <span class="caps">IRC</span> channels of that organisation. Don&#8217;t forget
   to read <span class="caps">IRC</span> etiquette. And honour them. One suggestion from my side is
   <em>try to be patient</em>. It mostly pays off. <a href="http://www.ircbeginner.com/ircinfo/etiquette.html">Click here</a> to read some
   general <span class="caps">IRC</span> etiquette. The organisation you want to get involved with
   might have their own guidelines so don&#8217;t forget to check that on their&nbsp;website/wiki.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Join mailing lists. Most of the <span class="caps">IRC</span> etiquette apply to mailing
   lists also. There might be some additional guidelines as well so look for
   those on your organisation&#8217;s website/wiki. <a href="http://kandalaya.org/guidelines.html">Click here</a>
   to read some general mailing list&nbsp;guidelines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their can be numerous ways of contributing to a project - coding,
   testing, documentation, localization, design, promotion, etc. GSoC is all
   about programming and contribution by coding will count in your
   selection. So you should work towards contributing by&nbsp;coding.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The best way to start contributing as a programmer is start solving
   bugs that are simple or marked for beginners/novices. Slowly you can
   move to more difficult problems. Don&#8217;t directly dive into something
   very&nbsp;difficult.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Almost every project/organisation has a page on their website that
   talks about how you can contribute to that project. For example,
   Drupal has <a href="http://drupal.org/getting-involved.">this page</a> on their website. These pages
   carry details to ways of documentation and how you can contribute as
   a programmer (or as a designer, etc.). Go ahead and read about how
   you can contribute code, the procedure, steps of contributing, coding
   standards and practices. <em>You must follow the guidelines strictly</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When stuck somewhere or don&#8217;t know where to start, write to the
   mailing list or talk to other contributors on the <span class="caps">IRC</span>. Tell them that
   you want to contribute but don&#8217;t know where to start and if they can
   lend a helping hand. <em>Remember: be polite and patient</em>! Generally
   their websites provide names of people who you can get in touch with
   on <span class="caps">IRC</span> for help. If there isn&#8217;t one on their website, then try to get
   in touch with those who are there on the <span class="caps">IRC</span>&nbsp;channel.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a couple of contributions, you can start talking about
    Google Summer of Code with people who have been helping you out so far.
    Tell them you want to participate. What is the best way or if there is any
    idea your contributor would like you to pitch for? Would they like to
    mentor you? You may also propose a project idea of your own. Read further
    on how to select a project&nbsp;idea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decide which the project idea you would like to work on. Try to have
    some people backing you up for your project&nbsp;idea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The official process will begin sometime in March when the
    participating organisations will be announced on GSoC&#8217;s&nbsp;website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After that registrations will open when you will have to register
    yourself. When you register, you will have to prepare a detailed proposal
    of what you want to do, how do you plan to achieve that, and a proper
    timeline of events: what milestone you will cover by&nbsp;when.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then the voting period will begin. Other contributors from your
    organisation will vote on all the proposed ideas associated to your
    organisation. The projects getting highest number of votes get selected.
    Every organisation has a fixed number of seats. For example in 2011 Drupal
    had 20 seats while Wordpress had around 10 seats. So out of all the
    proposed projects for Drupal, top 20 project with highest votes will get&nbsp;selected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will get notified when you get selected. You will have enough
    time before the project actually starts to get more comfortable in the
    community and communicate more often with your&nbsp;mentor(s).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Selecting your&nbsp;organization</h3>
<p>Selecting an organisation is the most important task as everything depends
on that. So read&nbsp;carefully:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A list of organisations that participated in GSoC 2011 is available
   <a href="http://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/accepted_orgs/google/gsoc2011.">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following are some parameters on the basis of which you may select an
   organisation for&nbsp;yourself:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Your current&nbsp;skills</strong></p>
<p>You are going to be coding after all. So you must consider what are
the technical skills required to get involved with an organisation/project.
For example, if you think you are good at C programming and algorithms,
then selecting Wordpress as an organisation might not help much because
Wordpress&#8217; code is written in <span class="caps">PHP</span>, <span class="caps">HTML</span>/<span class="caps">CSS</span>, JavaScript. You will have to
learn all that to get involved. So try selecting an organisation that in
someway fits your current technical skills. Obviously, you wouldn&#8217;t know
everything, but if you know something it will be easier for you to catch up
and learn other things related to what you already&nbsp;know.</p>
<p>You may select an organisation even if its technical requirements
don&#8217;t match your current skill set. But for that, you must have a strong
reason. For example:&nbsp;interest!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Your&nbsp;interests</strong></p>
<p>As discussed above, you should also take into consideration what you
are interested in. For example, you might be interested in Graphics (the
programming part, don&#8217;t confuse with Photoshop please) then you should go
for organisations related to graphics. If you are interested in networking,
try organisations like <span class="caps">NMAP</span>. If you are interested in Web Development, try
Drupal, Wordpress, Joomla, MediaWiki,&nbsp;etc.</p>
<p>If you have strong interest in something and you are determined to do
it, then your current skills don&#8217;t really matter that much. You will be
able to quickly learn and catch&nbsp;up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Projects/organisations you think are very&nbsp;cool</strong></p>
<p>This is another very important factor. You must believe that the
organisation you are going to choose is <span class="caps">COOL</span> and <span class="caps">DOES</span> <span class="caps">COOL</span> <span class="caps">WORK</span>. It is a
motivational factor. And that is what drives you to work for that&nbsp;organisation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is really the combination of the above three factors that you
   should consider. Give importance to all of the factors and decide wisely!
   It is also an important decision for a long term point of view. Google
   Summer of Code works towards creating new contributors who get involved
   with the organisation for a very long term and contribute. If you are
   applying, you are trying to get involved with that project deeply as well.
   And in my personal opinion, you must continue to contribute after GSoC as
   well. Work for a good cause! That means that you are going to work on that
   project and contribute to it in your free time. Therefore, the project you
   select must be a project that you really like as you are going to work on
   that for a long&nbsp;time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start working now!&nbsp;:)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Select a Project Idea for&nbsp;GSoC</h3>
<p>The second most important thing is select a project idea to work on. The
projects that were selected for GSoC 2011 can be found <a href="http://google-melange.appspot.com/gsoc/projects/list/google/gsoc2011">here</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Ideas proposed by the&nbsp;organisation</strong></p>
<p>Some communities propose ideas of their own and asks aspiring students
to apply to work on those ideas. Generally these ideas will already have
someone from the community who will be the owner of the idea and will be
mentoring for that&nbsp;project.</p>
<p>You may talk to the project idea owners about working on the idea you
like the most. Consider your skills. Do your homework before talking to
them. Read docs about that project idea on their website. Research. Try to
formulate a solution for the proposed project idea. When you talk to people
in the community about a particular idea, try to be as prepared as
possible. Create documents and host them online somewhere like Google Docs
or EtherPad so that the docs can be easily shared with&nbsp;others.</p>
<p>Generally the proposed idea will be available on the website of your
organisation. And the page may have a commenting system. Voice your
opinions there. Discuss&nbsp;ideas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ideas proposed by&nbsp;you</strong></p>
<p>You may also choose to propose an idea for GSoC. If you think that you
have a killer idea and you think it might be worth working on, then prepare
a nice proposal with all the details of your idea: problem statement,
current solutions (if any), your proposed solution, how you plan to execute
it, how much time you will take to work on it, work timeline, etc. Document
it somewhere - Google Docs, EtherPad, or you may also create something like
a wiki page on your organisation&#8217;s website (read guidelines before creating
wiki pages, etc.). Be professional, format properly, indent properly, add
links and images/diagrams where&nbsp;necessary.</p>
<p>You should then go ahead and discuss your idea with other contributors.
Listen to them. Discussions really help. Other contributors will help you
with making your idea even better. Their suggestions are very very
important. Talk to them over <span class="caps">IRC</span> so that others can also get involved in
the&nbsp;discussion.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Getting Selected for&nbsp;GSoC</h3>
<ul>
<li>The only way to get selected for GSoC is to prove that you will be
   able to do your&nbsp;project.</li>
<li>The only way to prove that you will be able to do your project is that
   show them your work and&nbsp;code.</li>
<li>College projects don&#8217;t help because:<ul>
<li>they might not be related to your organisation&#8217;s&nbsp;field.</li>
<li>they are mostly&nbsp;crappy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The best way to show that you can work is contributing code before
   talking to people about your project idea or before applying for an idea
   proposed by the&nbsp;community.</li>
<li>More the work you do, better are your chances of getting selected as
   that is the only way communities can judge your&nbsp;capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Coding&nbsp;Period</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The project coding period will officially begin sometime in May and
   you will receive your initial payment (in 2011 it was&nbsp;$500).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There will be a mid-term evaluation. The date will be published on
   GSoC&#8217;s website. You will have to prove that you have done work until then.
   Your organisation and your mentor will assess your progress. If they think
   that you have done good work, you will be passed and you may continue for
   with your project. You will then get another payment (in 2011 it was
   $2250). If they think that you have not lived up to their expectations, you
   will be disqualified from the program and will not be allowed to work
   further on that project as a GSoC project (however you can continue to work
   and still contribute but you won&#8217;t get&nbsp;paid).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In August, you will have your final evaluation when you will be
   required to submit everything. Your work will be assessed again by the
   organisation and your mentor. If you pass that, you will get your remaining
   payment, the GSoC t-shirt and the certificate (which is really cool). If
   you don&#8217;t pass that evaluation, you won&#8217;t get your final payment, t-shirt
   and&nbsp;certificate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The program ends&nbsp;here.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Help</h3>
<p>You can directly reach out to me and I will try to reply as soon as I can.
You may choose to post your problems on <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/jiitlug"><span class="caps">OSDC</span>&#8217;s mailing list</a>. That ways,
everyone will&nbsp;benefit.</p>
<p>Best of&nbsp;luck!</p>            </section>
