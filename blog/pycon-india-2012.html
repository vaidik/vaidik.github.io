                <h2>
                    <a href="">First Time at PyCon India</a>
                </h2>
                <p><a href="http://in.pycon.org/2012/">PyCon India 2012</a> happened in Bangalore this year and it was my first PyCon India ever.
Given that not a lot of good events/conferences for geeks happen here in Delhi/<span class="caps">NCR</span> and
<a href="http://us.pycon.org/2012/">PyCon <span class="caps">US</span></a> and <a href="http://denver2012.drupal.org/">DrupalCon Denver</a> were the last two conferences that I attended earlier this
year in March, I was getting impatient to attend another conference and get together with
some geeks. I like it because there is lots to learn from the sessions and the smart people 
who attend these events, and its always fun to know how busy the people you know are
innovating new and awesome&nbsp;stuff.</p>
<p>First of all, I&#8217;d like to thank the <a href="http://in.pycon.org/2012/">PyCon India</a> organizing team for the amazing hard work
they had put in. PyCon is a completely volunteer driven effort and wouldn&#8217;t have been
possible without the hard work put in by all the involved&nbsp;volunteers.</p>
<h3>Tutorials</h3>
<p>PyCon India was a 3-day long conference with the first day dedicated to tutorials and
the last two days taking care of the keynotes and presentations. There were a couple of
interesting tutorials. To start with in the first block of tutorials, the only one that
I found to be close to my interests was <a href="http://piyush.me/">Piyush Kumar&#8217;s</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/konarkmodi">Konark Modi&#8217;s</a> tutorial on
<a href="http://in.pycon.org/2012/funnel/pyconindia2012/62-celery-for-background-task-processing-and-deferred-execution">Background Task Processing and Deferred Execution using Celery</a>. Unfortunately, I missed
this one because I was catching up with some friends at the conference venue. In the
second slot of tutorials, again I found only one tutorial interesting and that was <a href="http://in.pycon.org/2012/funnel/pyconindia2012/55-simple-linux-cluster-with-python-and-beanstalkd">Building Simple Clusters using Beanstalkd</a>. I thought it would be something new but it was just about
using Message Queue systems to distribute tasks amongst your worker processes running on different machines, something
that I have already done before. I did leave that tutorial a bit early but I wouldn&#8217;t say
it was bad. Perhaps I misunderstood the topic a bit and was expecting too much out of it.
All in all, the only take away from the tutorials day was that I got to meet some old friends.
However, I wish it was not like that. Tutorials are a good opportunity for audience
of all kinds (i.e. beginner, intermediate and even expert) to learn something new.
Unfortunately, that was not the case this time. <span class="caps">IMHO</span>, the tutorial topics were either too
use-case specific or something that I already knew. :P Also, it was general feedback from
the people I know that the tutorial speakers were not very well prepared. I hope that
won&#8217;t be the case in the future conferences. Attendees buy tutorial tickets because they
really expect to learn something new and if they don&#8217;t get it, they get upset and perhaps
won&#8217;t attend tutorials in the&nbsp;future.</p>
<h3>Sessions</h3>
<p>The last two days of the conference had many sessions. I missed a couple of sessions that
I wanted to attend, including <a href="http://in.pycon.org/2012/funnel/pyconindia2012/46-automated-data-analysis-with-python">Anand&#8217;s session</a> (even the second time, shame on me). Out of
the four or five sessions that I attended, I found two sessions good. Most of the other
sessions gave me a feeling that the session speakers were not prepared at all whereas 
some sessions were merely presentation of documentation of existing Python libraries.
This is one thing that I wouldn&#8217;t want to experience again. In fact, if a person has
proposed a session, then that person must prepare it well because his audience expects 
that they will get to take something valuable away when they attend that session but
unfortunately many sessions at this PyCon had only disappointment as the only take away.
I am not going to name sessions here but some sessions were really bad. Yes, its the
responsibility of the organizers to make sure that the sessions are good. But, as a 
speaker I believe I would want not want to disappoint my audience at least content-wise
or I will not propose a session at all. Why volunteer to give a session when you are not
going to prepare properly? Session speakers must understand this that someone else could
perhaps present a better sessions with better content than theirs. I hope this will not happen again and the organizing committee 
will take care of this as they have already noticed this issue&nbsp;themselves.</p>
<p>I spoke at PyCon India as well. My session was on <a href="http://in.pycon.org/2012/funnel/pyconindia2012/34-queue-everything-and-please-everyone">Queues for Web Applications</a>. It was session for an audience
between beginner and intermediate level. As I earlier pointed out that many sessions were merely presentations
of documentations of some Python libraries and I expected that would happen as well, I made it a point to not
make my session a tutorial. So my session was more about how I got introduced to real-world queues and how I
understood things and started implementing it and went on to choose more complex and more sophisticated tools
to solve problems. I wouldn&#8217;t say that I was disappointed with the turn out. Though I was a little disappointed
with myself for getting nervous while presenting as it was the first time I spoke at a big event like PyCon India.
At the end, I did get some good comments from some people from the audience, some good questions as well and that 
made my day!&nbsp;:)</p>
<h3>Keynotes</h3>
<p>I at least expected the keynotes to be a little more interesting. The first keynote, by
David Mertz, was more centred around the <a href="http://www.python.org/psf/">Python Software Foundation</a> and related projects.
I am not indicating that it was a bad keynote, but not something that I take a lot of 
interest in or plan to do so in the near future (and that was the general feedback).
The second keynote, by <a href="http://jacobian.org">Jacob Kaplan Moss</a>, was definitely centred around an interesting
topic - the Real-Time Web and how he sees the web evolving. Real-Time Web is definitely a hot thing and <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2012/07/getusermedia-is-ready-to-roll/">WebRTC</a> looks like
an amazing initiative towards it. It will change a lot of things and not just web
applications. For example, Javascript APIs for capturing photophraphs and videos using 
device camera and accessing sound input from device microphone will enable developers to
challenge existing VoIP services. WebRTC is also working towards <span class="caps">P2P</span> amongst different
browsers, which again will open a whole new range of possibilities for&nbsp;developers.</p>
<p>Jacob&#8217;s demonstration of <a href="http://meteor.com">MeteorJS</a> was also interesting. Meteor allows developers to build
real-time apps really easily with almost the same set of Javascript APIs for the server
and the client. MeteorJS is pretty interesting. Its good to see the line between
client-server getting blurred. Jacob&#8217;s point was to make real-time apps in Django or 
similar frameworks right now is very very difficult whereas it shouldn&#8217;t be. You need to 
setup multiple systems and then make all of them work together to see some real-time
magic. Meteor definitely strives to make things like that really easy. Now, we cannot 
bring Python/Django on the client side like Meteor has done. But, do we really need to do
so immaterial of the fact that it is not possible? How difficult it really is right now
to make real-time apps with existing frameworks? How easy does Meteor make it? Can we be
sattisfied with something not as easy as Meteor but definitely much easier than existing
solutions? There are some interesting questions arounds this that I think about these
days. Perhaps I will write a post just on this if I am able to think of any concrete
approach. Anyways, Jacob&#8217;s talk was not bad, but not exciting enough as I was expecting
it to&nbsp;be.</p>
<h3>Overall&nbsp;Experience</h3>
<p>So these were the PyCon India 2012 days. Apart from the conference, I had an amazing time
meeting friends and new people. Want to thank <a href="http://twitter.com/flyankur">Ankur Saxena</a>, <a href="http://ashishdubey.info/blog/">Ashish Dubey</a>,
<a href="http://piyush.me/">Piyush Kumar</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/konarkmodi">Konark Modi</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/GurteshwarSingh">Gurteshwar Singh</a> for all the amazing conversations we had.
Got to learn lots from everyone! I would not say that the conference was bad but it was not
good enough and it can be much better and it should be much&nbsp;better!</p>
<p>Since I got involved with <span class="caps">FOSS</span> projects and communities in Delhi/<span class="caps">NCR</span>, I started attending
conferences and events because I feel that there always is a take away value in them in
the form of learning from sessions, experience, networking, and getting a chance to get
more deeply involved with these projects. At PyCon India 2012, this was really missing
and this is perhaps one of the factors that I will keep in mind in deciding to attend
or not to the next PyCon India. Lets see how the preparation of future PyCons in India
shapes&nbsp;up.</p>
