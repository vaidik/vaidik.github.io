[Incoming][incoming] is a JSON validation framework for Python. Validation of payloads
sent over HTTP requests has always been a mess. A bunch of if-then-else
further branching into more if-then-else blocks is common and over time
becomes extremely difficult to manage. Since the use of JSON
for HTTP payload is a common practice, it only made sense to solve the
problem of payload validation for payloads in JSON format. [Incoming][incoming] is an opinionated
JSON validation framework which does not bind to any kind of web frameworks.
It just tries to make JSON validation sensible and logical by giving it
structure and making it possible to re-use validation code across your
application.

### The Problem

Payload validation is a common problem that makes your web applications messy
and difficult to maintain. Especially if you are doing API development, getting
tangled in a bunch of if-then-else blocks happens really quickly. But that's not
the end of it. There are more problems that may come out or grow over time.
Let's list them down here:

1. Bunch of if-then-else blocks tangled with each other, which make management
   of code extremely difficult.
2. Abstracting out validation logic may become difficult over time, not because
   it is difficult, but there is no logical place to put all that together.
3. Reporting validation failures becomes too messy and difficult because there
   is no proper way to do it. You end up reporting validation failures
   incorrectly.

Put all these issues together, it makes sense to solve these problems together
as they seem common to most of the web applications, especially those that are
heavy on APIs.

### The Solution - [Incoming][incoming]

[Incoming][incoming] is an opinionated JSON validation framework that makes it
possible to validate JSON payloads with ease using structure. Its just a small
framework that makes it possible for you to solve the problems as listed in the
previous section in a sane way.

Although [Incoming][incoming] is a framework or task agnostic JSON validation
framework and it does not have to do anything with what it is used for, let's
use HTTP APIs as a reference for the sake of this post.

#### Structuring payload validation code into classes

First thing's first, let's get a place in our application to put together all
our payload validation code. How and why would this work? Usually, every HTTP
API end-point accepts a kind of payload that has a set format. In case of REST
APIs, the resources have a format for the payload. So it is possible to put
together all the validation in some place for an end-point or an API.
[Incoming][incoming] makes it possible for you. Let's get introduced to
Incoming's API.

Consider that there is an HTTP API that expects the following JSON payload:

    {
        "name": "Vaidik" // string,
        "age": 16 // integer,
        "gender": "male" // string, male or female only
    }

To validate the above payload using Incoming, we can write the validator like
so:

    import json

    from incoming import datatypes, PayloadValidator

    class PersonValidator(PayloadValidator):

        name = datatypes.String()
        age = datatypes.Integer()
        gender = datatypes.Function('validate_gender')

        def validate_gender(self, val, **kwargs):
            val = val.lower()
            if val == 'male' or val == 'female':
                return True
            return False

    validator = PersonValidator()

    payload1 = {
        'name': 'Vaidik Kapoor',
        'age': 16.5,
        'gender': 'mail'
    }
    validator.validate(payload1)
    '''
    Returns:
    (False,
     {'age': ['Invalid data. Expected an integer.'],
      'gender': ['Invalid data.']})
    '''

    payload2 = {
        'name': 'Vaidik Kapoor',
        'age': 16,
        'gender': 'male'
    }
    validator.validate(payload2)
    '''
    Returns:
    (True, None)
    '''

This is a simple payload validator written using Incoming. This shows how
Incoming makes it possible for you to quickly do simple validations of
fundamental data types and at the same time allows you to do validations using
separate methods. These methods don't have to be instance methods. Instead they
can be static methods or class methods or even functions as well.

#### Getting rid of tangled if-then-else blocks which are difficult to read

Consider the following example:

    {
        "name": "Vaidik", // string
        "age": 16, // integer
        "gender": "male" // string, male or female only
        "department": "engineering", // string, possible values are engineering,
                                     // marketing, sales
        "github": "https://github.com/vaidik" // string, required if department
                                              // is engineering
    }

There are two new fields in this example. One is `department` - this field can
take `engineering`, `marketing` and `sales` as values. There is another optional
field called `github`. This field is required only if `department` is
`engineering`.

This is how we can validate this using Incoming:

    import json

    from incoming import datatypes, PayloadValidator

    class PersonValidator(PayloadValidator):

        name = datatypes.String()
        age = datatypes.Integer()
        gender = datatypes.Function('validate_gender',
                                    required=False)
        department = datatypes.Function('validate_department')
        github = datatypes.Function('validate_github', required=False)

        def validate_gender(self, val, **kwargs):
            if val == 'male' or val == 'female':
                return True
            return False

        def validate_department(self, val, **kwargs):
            if val in ('engineering', 'marketing', 'sales'):
                return True
            return False

        # the entire payload is passed to every validation method or
        # function
        def validate_github(self, val, payload, **kwargs):
            if payload.get('department', None) == 'engineering':
                if val is None:
                    return False
            return True

We can see that you can now easily validate the field `github` and the
validation may depend on the value of other fields. How we do that is that we
pass the entire payload to every validation function or method as a keyword
argument. You can make use of this to write validation rules for one field that
may depend on the values of other field or fields.

#### Organizing validation logic and code in a more sensible place

Incoming tries to make validation more organized and structured as usually
validation is the part that goes every where in your application and starts
scattering really quickly.

I introduced Incoming for validation earlier in this article with an example,
wherein we used classes for organizing validation code for JSON payloads. So
here is the first thing - Incoming makes use of classes to make it possible to
put together validation for different types of payloads.

Other than validation of basic fundamental data types, Incoming provides ways to
use functions or methods to write validation logic for handling more complex
types of validations. And in real-world applications, you will end up having
complex validations. Important thing is that if you can organize this validation
logic and make it re-usable so that the same logic can be used outside of the
scope of Incoming if you choose to do so. In the previous examples, we have used
instance methods for validation. However, Incoming also supports you to use
static methods, class methods and functions as well for writing validations. So
instance methods work just fine but in case you want to use the same logic at
other places in your application, you can look at functions, class methods or
static methods as well. See the following example:

    import json

    from incoming import datatypes, PayloadValidator

    def validate_age(val, **kwargs):
        if val > 0:
            return True
        return False

    class PersonValidator(PayloadValidator):

        name = datatypes.String()
        age = datatypes.Function(validate_age)  # notice that reference to
                                                # validation function is
                                                # passed instead of name of the
                                                # method as a string in other
                                                # cases
        gender = datatypes.Function('validate_gender',
                                    required=False)
        department = datatypes.Function('validate_department')
        github = datatypes.Function('validate_github', required=False)

        @classmethod
        def validate_gender(cls, val, **kwargs):
            if val == 'male' or val == 'female':
                return True
            return False

        def validate_department(self, val, **kwargs):
            if val in ('engineering', 'marketing', 'sales'):
                return True
            return False

        # the entire payload is passed to every validation method or
        # function
        @staticmethod
        def validate_github(val, payload, **kwargs):
            if payload.get('department', None) == 'engineering':
                if val is None:
                    return False
            return True

Notice that `validate_age` is a function, `validate_gender` is a class method
and `validate_github` is a static method. This makes all the three callables
useful outside the scope of Incoming as well.

#### Reporting validation failures with proper error messages

This is the kicker. Getting error messages right becomes as difficult and makes
things even more messier and you can easily start loosing consistency in error
messages very soon. Incoming makes it possible for you to handle error messages
nicely.

Incoming validates each and every field that is provided in the payload and that
is absent in the payload but was mentioned in the payload validator's
definition. Every time validation fails for any field, Incoming catches the
failure and returns sensible error messages. Consider the following example:

    import json

    from incoming import datatypes, PayloadValidator

    class PersonValidator(PayloadValidator):

        name = datatypes.String()
        age = datatypes.Integer()
        gender = datatypes.Function('validate_gender',
                                    required=False)
        department = datatypes.Function('validate_department')
        github = datatypes.Function('validate_github', required=False)

        def validate_gender(self, val, **kwargs):
            if val == 'male' or val == 'female':
                return True
            return False

        def validate_department(self, val, **kwargs):
            if val in ('engineering', 'marketing', 'sales'):
                return True
            return False

        # the entire payload is passed to every validation method or
        # function
        def validate_github(self, val, payload, **kwargs):
            if payload.get('department', None) == 'engineering':
                if val is None:
                    return False
            return True

    validator = PersonValidator()
    validator.validate(dict(name='Vaidik', age=16.5, gender='mail'))
    '''
    Returns:
    (False,
     {'age': ['Invalid data. Expected an integer.'],
      'department': ['Expecting a value for this field.'],
      'gender': ['Invalid data.']})
    '''

Incoming does not stop validating other fields after first validation failure.
The reason behind this decision was that all the validation failures should be
reported at once so that the end user can fix the payload before trying again
and keep on doing hit-and-trial. And part of the reason behind this decision was
because Incoming was written for web applications to start with, which usually
have APIs with end users or consumers. Making multiple requests for every field
in the payload just for checking if the payload validates is rather painful for
the end user.

Note that the validation for both `age` and `gender` failed. Since `age` is of
type `Integer`, Incoming returned an error message saying that an integer was
expected. In case of 'gender', Incoming just says `Invalid data.` because in
case of type `Function`, Incoming does not know the reason of failure. While 
this is a good beginning for handling error messages, the error message in case
of `gender` field is not very helpful to the end user.

There is support for custom error messages when validation fails. This means
that although Incoing has sane error messages by default, you can always add
more accurate error messages with respect to your application. Furthermore,
Incoming allows you to control error messages for every field in your payload.
Consider the following example:

    import json

    from incoming import datatypes, PayloadValidator

    class PersonValidator(PayloadValidator):

        name = datatypes.String(error='name must be a string')
        age = datatypes.Integer(error='age must be an integer')
        gender = datatypes.Function('validate_gender',
                                    required=False,
                                    error=('gender can be either male or
                                           'female'))
        department = datatypes.Function('validate_department')
        github = datatypes.Function('validate_github', required=False)

        def validate_gender(self, val, **kwargs):
            if val == 'male' or val == 'female':
                return True
            return False

        def validate_department(self, val, **kwargs):
            if val in ('engineering', 'marketing', 'sales'):
                return True
            return False

        # the entire payload is passed to every validation method or
        # function
        def validate_github(self, val, payload, **kwargs):
            if payload.get('department', None) == 'engineering':
                if val is None:
                    return False
            return True

    validator = PersonValidator()
    validator.validate(dict(name='Vaidik', age=16.5, gender='mail'))
    '''
    Returns:
    (False,
     {'age': ['age must be an integer'],
      'department': ['Expecting a value for this field.'],
      'gender': ['gender can be either male or female']})
    '''

Notice that you can easily override error messages while defining your validator
class. Every field type accepts a keyword argument called `error` which takes a
string as a value which shall be used if the field's value in the payload is
invalid.

With fields that have complicated validation logic, one generic error message
may not be enough. You can conditionally push additional error messages in your
validation functions or methods. Every validation function or method gets a
keyword argument called `errors` which is an array of error messages for that
field. You can push error messages in the array easily, like so:

    import json

    from incoming import datatypes, PayloadValidator

    class PersonValidator(PayloadValidator):

        name = datatypes.String(error='name must be a string')
        age = datatypes.Integer(error='age must be an integer')
        gender = datatypes.Function('validate_gender',
                                    required=False,
                                    error=('gender can be either male or '
                                           'female'))
        department = datatypes.Function('validate_department')
        github = datatypes.Function('validate_github', required=False)

        def validate_gender(self, val, **kwargs):
            if val == 'male' or val == 'female':
                return True
            return False

        def validate_department(self, val, **kwargs):
            if val in ('engineering', 'marketing', 'sales'):
                return True
            return False

        def validate_github(self, val, payload, errors, **kwargs):
            if payload.get('department', None) == 'engineering':
                if val is None:
                    errors.append('Value required for github when department '
                                  'is set to "engineering".')
                    return False
                elif 'github.com' not in val:
                    errors.append('Value for field github must be a valid '
                                  'Github profile link.')
                    return False
            return True

    validator = PersonValidator()
    validator.validate(dict(name='Vaidik', age=16, department='engineering'))
    '''
    Returns:
    (False,
     {'gender': ['gender can be either male or female'],
      'github': ['Invalid data.',
                 'Value required for github when department is set to "engineering".']})
    '''

    validator.validate(dict(name='Vaidik', age=16, department='engineering',
                        github='http://gitub.com/vaidik'))
    '''
    Returns:
    (False,
     {'gender': ['gender can be either male or female'],
      'github': ['Invalid data.',
                 'Value for field github must be a valid Github profile link.']})
    '''

    validator.validate(dict(name='Vaidik', age=16, department='engineering',
                            github='http://github.com/vaidik'))
    '''
    Returns:
    (False, {'gender': ['gender can be either male or female']})
    '''

Incoming also has the notion of `required` fields. By default, all fields are
required. If a required field is missing, Incoming reports that in the
validation response. For the above validator class, lets try to validate the
following payload:

    validator.validate(dict(name='Vaidik', age=10))
    '''
    Returns:
    (False, {'department': ['Expecting a value for this field.']})
    '''

By default, Incoming will use the above error message for missing required
fields in the payload. This message can be overridden in the class definition
by setting a class variable `required_error` like so:

    class PersonValidator(PayloadValidator):

        required_error = 'A value for this field must be provided.'
        ...

    validator.validate(dict(name='Vaidik', age=10))
    '''
    Returns:
    (False, {'department': ['A value for this field must be provided.']})
    '''

The above example shows how you can customize your error messages for missing
fields that are required.

### Wrap Up

There are many things that I was not able to cover in this blog post. You can
find them in the [docs][docs].

My personal pains with validating payloads led me to work on Incoming. It seems
like a decent solution to me as of now. I tried my best to cover as many
use-cases as possible but I will not be surprised if I have missed some. I have
tried my best to keep the API as simple, tidy and easy to comprehend as
possible with a lot of focus on readability of validators. And I sure will be
adding features to Incoming in the near future as the need arises.

Does this look like a decent solutin to you? Would you use it in your next
application? Yes or no - I would love to hear your thoughts!
