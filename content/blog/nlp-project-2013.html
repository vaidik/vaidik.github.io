In the recent years, we have seen that the number of mobile users have grown
exponentially. With smart phones coming in, information is available to most
anywhere and everywhere. However, it is available to only those who can afford
it.

Accessing information on an old phone that cannot support, for example,
opening a website is rather limited. The need for the same can be supported by
the fact that most of Indian mobile users are still largely limited to using
old mobile phones than new powerful smart phones because either they can't 
afford it or they are not educated enough to operate them. And that makes it
difficult to for that audience to get information on-the-move. Similarly, the
number of telecomm users in India is approx. ten times more than the number of
Internet users.

The importance of making information available to such an audience is
extremely important. Even MediaWiki has realized [the importance of this][WIKI]
for Wikipedia. SMS and Voice Calls are the interfaces left for exchange of
information in that case.

In this project, our goal is to accept queries via SMS and respond to the
sender by finding the most appropriate FAQ from a corpus of FAQs. 

The presentation we prepared to present our synopsis during the
class can be found [here][SLIDES].

The project members for this project are:

 - Aahana Tomar
