Yes, finally I have done it. After delaying it for so long, I have finally made
my new blog. Its not complete yet but its mostly done. There is a lot I have been
wanting to write for some time now and I don't like the idea of using
Wordpress.com or Blogspot or Blogger or any other blogging platform out there for
some reason. I want my blog, made with love and care! :)

My old blog was made on [Wordpress][WP] and an existing theme I had almost completely
customized. This new blog is made using [Hyde][H]. Hyde is a [static site generator][ssg], like [Jekyll][J] which powers [Github Pages][GP], and it is written in [Python][Py]. Why did I not
choose Jekyll - because of Python. I know Python and I don't know [Ruby][Rb]. I didn't
even have plans to learn it or anything about it. Hyde, on the other hand, is
built on top of a [Django][Dj], one of the best web frameworks out there and it uses
[Jinja2][j2] for templating.

As I said, this blog is only almost complete. So you will see things changing and
new things coming in very soon here.

Also, I expressed that I wish to write. And that's true. Unfortunately, I have
exams starting tomorrow in college. So my actual *first blog post* on this shiny
new blog of mine is due.

**Breaking news** - if you are/were looking for any of my old blog posts, I am sorry
I am not going to put them back because I can't - I lost my old blog's backup.
Yes, that raises a lot of questions - "did you not have a backup", etc. Something
messy happened sometime back when I lost a lot of my precious data, including the
backup of my old blog. So... really sorry!
