description: 
    This article is the first in the series of understanding how Non Blocking
    I/O works in Python. This article takes example of a simple TCP server and
    client as an example and improves the client script to be non-blocking using
    select module. At last, we see example of how to implement an event loop for
    handling network events using select and generators in Python.

As someone working with the web stack and languages like Python or Ruby, there
are high chances that you have heard of Non Blocking I/O. You might as well be
using it with some of your projects or have tried your hands with libraries
like Gevent or Tornado. But how do these libraries make network requests non
blocking. This is something that I had always wondered when I tried Gevent. I
just couldn't get my head around the fact that when you send something to a
socket or receive from it, it will block execution for the at least the amount
of time it takes to transmit the data. So how do I make it possible to execute
something else while I/O is happening? So I started digging in, trying to
understand how to make some network request non blocking in Python.

With this article series, I will try to introduce the topic and go in as much
detail as possible.

### What is Non Blocking I/O?

So first lets see what is **Blocking**? A function is blocking if it has to wait
for something to complete. Yes, every function is blocking - no matter if you
are doing I/O or doing CPU task. Everything takes some time. If a function is
doing some task which is making the CPU work, then it is blocking the function
from returning. Similarly, if a function is trying to get something from the
database, then it is going to wait for the result to come and will block until
then to continue the processing. But it so happens that the server is not making
any use of the CPU while it is waiting for the database to send the response.

So if a function is blocking (for whatever reasons), it is capable of delaying
execution of other tasks. And the overall progress of the entire system may get
suffered. If the function is blocking because it is doing some CPU task, well
then we cannot do much. But if it is blocking because of I/O, we know that the
CPU is idle and can be used for starting another task that needs CPU.

Lets see an example of blocking network request. I have a very simple TCP server
written in Python:

    import socket
    import sys

    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

    port = 1234 if len(sys.argv) == 1 else int(sys.argv[1])
    sock.bind(('localhost', port))
    sock.listen(5)

    try:
        while True:
            conn, info = sock.accept()

            data = conn.recv(1024)
            while data:
                print data
                data = conn.recv(1024)
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        sock.close

And here is a simple client to connect to our server:

    import socket

    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    sock.connect(('localhost', 1234))

    data = 'foobar\n' * 10 * 1024 * 1024  # 70 MB of data
    assert sock.send(data) == len(data)  # True

The above code will block for a long period of time. If there was code after the
last time, it will not get executed until `send` method returns. What is going
on here? The `send()` method will try to transmit all the data while the write
buffer will get filled up. The kernel will put the process to sleep until the
data in the buffer is transferred to destination and the buffer is empty again.
When the buffer becomes empty, the kernel will wake the process up again to
get the next chunk of data that is to be transferred. In short, your code will
block and it will not let anything else proceed.

Lets make the above example NOT block:

    import socket

    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    sock.connect(('localhost', 1234))
    sock.setblocking(0)

    data = 'foobar\n' * 10 * 1024 * 1024  # 70 MB of data
    assert sock.send(data) == len(data)  # AssertionError

When you run the above client, you will notice that it did not block at all. But
there is a problem with the client - it did not send all the data.
`socket.send` method returns the number of bytes sent. When you make a
socket non-blocking by calling `setblocking(0)`, it will never wait for the
operation to complete. So when you call the `send()` method, it will put as much
data in the buffer as possible and return. As this is read by the remote
connection, the data is removed from the buffer. If the buffer gets ***full***
and we continue to send data, `socket.error` will be raised. When you try to
send data more than the buffer can accommodate, only the amount of data that
can be accommodated is actually sent and `send()` returns the number of bytes
sent. This is useful so that we can try to send the remaining data when the
buffer becomes empty. Let's try to achieve that:

    import errno
    import select
    import socket

    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    sock.connect(('localhost', 1234))
    sock.setblocking(0)

    data = 'foobar\n' * 1024 * 1024
    data_size = len(data)
    print 'Bytes to send: ', len(data)

    total_sent = 0
    while len(data):
        try:
            sent = sock.send(data)
            total_sent += sent
            data = data[sent:]
            print 'Sending data'
        except socket.error, e:
            if e.errno != errno.EAGAIN:
                raise e
            print 'Blocking with', len(data), 'remaining'
            select.select([], [sock], [])  # This blocks until

    assert total_sent == data_size  # True

In the above example, we make sure that we keep trying to send the remaining
data as long as we have not sent all of it. When the write buffer is full and
cannot accommodate more data, `EAGAIN` error is raised asking us to try again.
If you examine the exception object, the exception message is "Resource
temporarily unavailable". So we keep trying to send the remaining data until we
have sent it all.

### Understanding select()

The last line of the above example introduces the [select][1] module. select module
helps us with dealing with multiple file descriptors at once. The select module
includes implementations of `select`, `poll`, `epoll` and `kqueue`, which are
used by libraries like eventlet, twisted, tornado and others. We will look at
them later in the coming articles of this series. Since we made our socket
non-blocking, we don't know when can we actually write to it unless we keep
trying to write to it and expect it to not fail. This is a major waste of CPU
time. In the above example, we call the `select()` function to avoid exactly
that.

`select()` expects three arguments - list of file descriptors to watch for
reading, list of file descriptors to watch for writing and list of file
descriptors to watch for errors. Timeout can be passed as an optional 4th
argument which can be used to prevent `select()` from blocking indefinitely.
It returns a subset of all the three lists passed in the same order i.e. all
the file descriptors that are ready for reading, writing or have caused some
error.

We call the `select()` function and pass it file descriptors asking it to tell
us which of these are ready for reading or writing. In the above example,
`select()` blocks if there is no file descriptor that is ready to work with.
You might say that this is still blocking the execution of our program but this
is just the foundation for building better things. As of now, `select()` will
just block until our sock object becomes writeable again. If we remove that
line, our script will continue to work but a lot more useless while loop
iterations will be run as most of them will result in exceptions.

But how does `select()` really work? Well, `select()` is nothing but an
interface to the Unix `select()` system call. And its pretty easy to understand
as the usage does not differ so much from the Python interface. For the curious
ones, you can read more about in the [man page for select][man_select] and at
these links:

### Introduction to event loops for network events

Now that we understand `select` better, lets make use of it to do better than
our last example where we actually make use of making a socket non-blocking. We
are going to make use of generators to make sure that our script does not block
execution of other things and let other code proceed as well. Consider this
example:

    import errno
    import select
    import socket
    import time


    def other_task():
        i = 0
        while i < 2000:
            i += 1
            print i
            time.sleep(0.02)
            yield


    def send_data_task(port, data):
        sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
        sock.connect(('localhost', port))
        sock.setblocking(0)

        data = (data + '\n') * 1024 * 1024
        print 'Bytes to send: ', len(data)

        total_sent = 0
        while len(data):
            try:
                sent = sock.send(data)
                total_sent += sent
                data = data[sent:]
                print 'Sending data'
            except socket.error, e:
                if e.errno != errno.EAGAIN:
                    raise e
                yield ('w', sock)

        print 'Bytes sent: ', total_sent


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        tasks = [
            other_task(),
            send_data_task(port=1234, data='foo'),
            send_data_task(port=5678, data='bar'),
        ]

        fds = dict(w={}, r={})
        while len(tasks) or len(fds['w']) or len(fds['r']):
            new_tasks = []
            for task in tasks:
                try:
                    resp = next(task)
                    try:
                        iter(resp)
                        fds[resp[0]][resp[1]] = task
                    except TypeError:
                        # this task has to be done since not dependent on any fd
                        new_tasks.append(task)
                except StopIteration:
                    # function completed
                    pass

            if len(fds['w'].keys()) or len(fds['r'].keys()):
                readable, writeable, exceptional = select.select(
                    fds['r'].keys(), fds['w'].keys(), [], 0)
                for readable_sock in readable:
                    new_tasks.append(fds['r'][fd])
                    del fds['r'][fd]
                for fd in writeable:
                    new_tasks.append(fds['w'][fd])
                    del fds['w'][fd]
                # ignore exceptional for now

            tasks = new_tasks

For running this example, we are going to run two instances of servers and make
our script do two things simultaneously - run a function that just increments
a variable in a loop and send data to two servers. Both the servers are
essentially the same. They are just running on different ports so that our
script can connect to two servers at the same time.

In the above example, we have two functions `send_data_task()` and
`other_task()`. `send_data_task()` tries to send a lot of data to a TCP server.
`other_task()` just runs a counter. We want to execute both the functions. If
we execute them one by one, then we end up blocking the one executing later.
However, we can have both the functions proceed simultaneously. We make use of
non-blocking sockets and generators to make two functions proceed
co-operatively.

The `send_data_task()` function creates a non-blocking socket and tries to send
data just like our previous example. The only difference is that it `yields`
when the write buffer gets full and an exception is raised. Since we cannot
send any more data through the socket any more, we can have another block of
code proceed that does not depend on this function. `other_task()` function is
a simple function for this example that just runs a counter in a loop. This
function also yields after every iteration of the loop.

In case of `send_data_task()`, we `yield` when we cannot send more data since
our write buffer is full. But when we yield, we also return a tuple with the
type of operations on the socket ('w' for write, 'r' for read) and the socket
object itself. When the execution is returned to the callee, we maintain a
mapping of socket objects to the generator that returned it.

In case of `other_task`, we yield after every iteration. Why? If we don't do
that, the function will continue to execute until it has completed all that it
has to do and our other function `send_data_task()` will not get a chance to
proceed. So we consciously try to switch execution to another function whenever
possible. Since this function does not depend on any fd or socket object, we
don't return anything when we yield. This is just a way we have designed our
implementation - ugly as it may look but it keeps things simple to understand.

In our main block, we maintain a list of functions that we want to call in a
list called `tasks`. To be precise, both our functions use `yield` and hence
return generators when we call them. So `tasks` actually maintains a list of
generators returned by the functions we want to co-operatively execute. We run
a loop as long as our tasks don't complete their execution. On every iteration
of the loop, we run each task one-by-one using the `next()` function. The
function resumes its execution and yields whenever it can.

The while loop runs as long as tasks list is not empty or we have any fds or
socket objects to watch. We run every task one-by-one. When we call
`send_data_task`, it yields a tuple with the operation (reading or writing) we
were performing on the socket and the socket object itself. We keep the socket
object in a dictionary called `fds` where we maintain two different
dictionaries of objects - one for those which we are writing to and another for
those we are reading from. Then we run the `other_task()` and it yields nothing.

The execution gets returned to the main block. After executing the tasks, we
see if there are any socket objects or fds that we need to watch using
`select()` and call it accordingly. `select()` returns a subset of sockets/fds
that can be read from or written to. If we can read from a or write to any
socket/fd, we look for the corresponding generator in the corresponding
dictionary in `fds` and append it to a new list of tasks that shall be executed
in the next iteration of our main while loop. Finally, we just replace tasks
with `new_tasks` so that the while loops picks up the new tasks.

This keeps on running until we have no tasks left in the tasks list and no more
sockets/fds to watch. And this way, our functions co-operatively let each other
proceed. The example is perhaps ugly and not even close to real-world usage but
its simple and it gets the idea across.

That large while loop that you see in our main block is our implementation of
event loop for our script. What does it do? It just watches for network events
and schedules corresponding code blocks to run as and when they can. However,
our implementation is a very simple implementation and it surely does not handle
the most common things. It is just enough for undersanding the concept.

### Examples

All the code examples in this article can be found [here][examples].

### What's next?

That was an introduction on how you can make sockets non-blocking and use select
function from the select module to watch file descriptors for reading or
writing. We understood how select() works, made a script that does network I/O
not block using non-blocking sockets and made use of generators and select() to
implement a very simple I/O loop.

In the next article, we will look at more examples and look at other
infrastructure for handling non-blocking sockets such as poll and epoll.
