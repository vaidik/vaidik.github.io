[Vagrant][vagrant] is an amazing tool for developing throw-away dev environment
that closely resembles production. It greatly reduces turn around times and
effort on setting up your development environment. It gives you the flexibility
to experiment around, play with new experimental stuff and if you mess it up,
then you can easily destroy and quickly re-create another one.

You may find a ton of projects on Github that make use of Vagrant for
development. However, they use Vagrant for development of the project alone.
That may work fine with one off projects or open-source projects. In a real
world scenario where you have more than one projects working together, setting
them up locally may be difficult. This post presents a way you can use Vagrant
in an Service Oriented Architecture where it may be possible for you to use the
same Vagrant setup with multiple projects.

## Our Requirements

This is something that I spent a considerable amount of time while working with
my previous employer - [Wingify](https://wingify.com). At Wingify, one of my
responsibilities was how can I improve developer productivity and ensure that
the software that gets pushed to production actually works after deployment. The
things that I considered were essential for a good development environment are:

**Developer Productivity** - make sure that developers' productivity and
ease-of-development is not compromised. Vagrant uses virtualized environments
for setting up dev environments. It works with [Virtualbox][virtualbox]
[out-of-the-box][virtualbox-provider]. We had to make sure that developers
don't have to use different tools (like IDE) even if their code is running in
virtualized environments.

**Configuration Management** - configuration and system orchestration has to be
managed through code. Infrastructure must be codified so that both Ops and Devs
can read it, understand it, modify it as needed and eventually everyone
contributes to it. We were already using [Puppet][puppet] for this. The best
thing is that Vagrant works with Puppet. And not just with Puppet, it works with
a ton of other [configuration management tools][provisioners]. So you can use
your favorite tool.

**Dev/Prod Parity** - One of the first things to do in this case was make sure
that the developers are at least using the same set of tools and setting up
their development environments exactly the same way as we will setup the
production servers. If you are using configuration management tools, it should
be fairly simple to put together a development environment provisioned using
them. But its not just that. Even minute things like lack of a proxy in
development environment for connect to another TCP service can lead to a failure
in production. To avoid such things, well... provision all intermediate layers
as well. For example, we use [mysql-proxy][mysql-proxy] in production to
connect to our [MySQL][mysql] servers. We made sure that in our development
environment, our apps also make use of mysql-proxy to connect to MySQL instead
of working with it directly.

**All essential services must be provisioned** - the stage at which I had made
it a priority to make dev environments productive was the stage where we already
had tons of services (written by us) that together made our product work. Not
all of them were essential for day-to-day development of our product, but at
least a few were. So the most important problem to solve for us was how to make
the dev environment have the critical services automatically set up, leaving
enough room to add new services later. This was also important, especially with
respect to how people use Vagrant essentially i.e. using it to work on one
independent project.

## Customizing Vagrant, just a little bit

Vagrant's getting started docs are pretty good with getting you to have your
first development environment set up really quickly. But if you don't pay
attention to the campabilities of what Vagrant can do, you may end up not using
Vagrant to the best of its abilities.

### Dedicate a repositorty for your Vagrant setup

One of our needs was to have multiple projects available in our
development environment. You can achieve this with Vagrant using [Synced
Folders][synced-folders]. Synced Folders share a folder on your machine at a
specified location on your guest machine. This makes it easy for developers to
keep using the tools they love on their host machine (things like IDEs, other
CLI tools, etc.).

Usually how different projects use Vagrant and Synced Folders is they drop
Vagrantfile in the root of the project and share the current directory `"."`
with the guest machine using Synced Folders.

    webapplication/
        models/
        views/
        controllers/
        README.md
        Vagrantfile         # Vagrant configuration
        vagrant/            # Provisioning scripts, bash, Puppet, ansible, etc.

The Vagrantfile in this above typical project will use the Synced Folder feature
to share the code like so:

<pre><code class="ruby">
config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/var/www/webapplication"
</code></pre>

So when you run `vagrant up`, the above directory is shared and made available
in the virtual machine. The scripts in the `vagrant/` directory are used for
setting up the rest of the things required to run the `webapplication`.

As this may work wonderfully with an independent project, this organization of
Vagrant configuration and projects fails in the case when you want multiple
projects provisioned in the same environment because its hard to decide where
to put all the configuration.

So we decided to go ahead and make a seperate project for all Vagrant related
stuff. Our Vagrant setup looks like this:

<pre><code class="bash">
dev-environment/
    hiera/
    lib/
    scripts/
    README.md
    Vagrantfile
    nodes.pp
    hiera.yaml
    config.default.yml
    ...                 # Some other stuff
</code></pre>

Let me explain what are these things for:

1. **hiera/**, **hiera.yaml**, **nodes.pp**: this is all Puppet specific stuff
   that we will see later.
2. **lib/**: Ruby code that is used for doing some custom stuff with Vagrant. We
   will see this shortly.
3. **scripts/**: a few Bash scripts for doing some very basic setups like
   installing some extra dependencies for Puppet.
4. **config.default.yml**: A reference configuration file, which is more
   developer friendly. It is used by the Vagrantfile.
5. **Vagranfile**: the standard Vagrantfile with some modifications.

### Flexibile configuration in Vagrantfile

Vagrant environments are configured using something called a
[Vagrantfile][vagrantfile]. All the configuration related to your Vagrant
environment resides here. It describes the type of machine required for your
project and how to provision this machine.

The syntax of Vagrantfile is [Ruby][ruby]. You don't have to know the language
for working with Vagrantfile. The syntax is pretty simple. But if you do know
the language, you can do a lot with Vagrantfile(s). Since a Vagrantfile just has
Ruby code, you can do a lot of fancy things in there to make Vagrant work
according to your needs.

The `config.default.yml` file in the previous section is just a reference
configuration file. It needs to be copied. Our setup requires a `config.yml`
file instead of the default file but in the same format. The `config.yml` file
looks something like this:

<pre><code class="yaml">
---
scm:
    github:
        enabled: true
        api_token: null       # set your API token here
    bitbucket:
        enabled: true
        api_token: null       # set your API token here
puppet:
    path: <path to puppet>
projects:
    website: <Path to website>
    webapplication: <Path to webapplication>
    queue-workers: <Path to queue-workers>
    analytics-service: <Path to analytics-service>
</code></pre>

The config file is in [YAML][yaml] format. At the beginning of the
`Vagrantfile`, we parse the contents which are available through out the file.
This file lists down multiple things. We will see each one of them one-by-one.

### Using Synced Folders to sync multiple projects

**projects**: This key in `config.yml` is the list of projects that we would
like to be set up in our Vagrant environment. In our `Vagrantfile`, we just use
Synced Folders to make these projects available at the locations they should be
made available at.

<pre><code class="ruby">
app.vm.synced_folder vagrant_config["projects"]["website"],
    "/var/www/website",
    owner: 'www-data',
    group: 'www-data',
    mount_options: ["dmode=775,fmode=664"]
app.vm.synced_folder vagrant_config["projects"]["webapplication"],
    "/var/www/webapplication",
    owner: 'www-data',
    group: 'www-data',
    mount_options: ["dmode=775,fmode=664"]
app.vm.synced_folder vagrant_config["projects"]["queue-workers"],
    "/opt/queue-workers",
    owner: 'queue_workers',
    group: 'queue_workers',
    mount_options: ["dmode=775,fmode=664"]
app.vm.synced_folder vagrant_config["projects"]["analytics-service"],
    "/opt/analytics-service",
    owner: 'analytics',
    group: 'analytics',
    mount_options: ["dmode=775,fmode=664"]
</code></pre>

This does a few things that are important for our environment:

1. Developers organize their projects differently. Every project may lie at a
   different location from host to host. This way, developers can put their
   projects anywhere on their machine and then configure our Vagrant set up to
   sync the code in the guest machine from the locations specified in
   `config.yml`.
2. If a new project needs to be provisioned, then you can just add the project
   in `config.yml`, add it in `Vagrantfile` like above and have Puppet do the
   set up. This way adding new projects does not require a lot of work.

### Puppet for provisioning

**puppet** - this key creates a space for customizing the Puppet setup we use
for setting up Vagrant. How we use Puppet at Wingify is that there is one
repository where all the Puppet modules, manifests and Hiera data lies. When
setting up the development environment using this project, one of the first
steps to use Vagrant is clone this Puppet code-base somewhere on your host
machine. Then add the Path to the project in your Vagrantfile.

This is what we do in our `Vagrantfile`:

<pre><code class="ruby">
config.vm.provision "puppet" do |puppet|
	modulepath = File.join(vagrant_config["puppet"]["path"], "modules")
	config.vm.synced_folder vagrant_config["puppet"]["path"], "/etc/puppet"

	puppet.manifests_path = "."
	puppet.module_path = modulepath
	puppet.manifest_file = "nodes.pp"
	puppet.hiera_config_path = "hiera.yaml"

	puppet.facter = {
		"in_vagrant"       => true,
	}
	puppet.options = "--parser future"
end
</code></pre>

Using this, we configure Vagrant to use Puppet in a slightly different way. This
tells Vagrant to load the Puppet modules from the Puppet repository, use the
site manifest which is seperate for Vagrant machines which is lying in this
repository i.e. vagrant repository - `nodes.pp`.

#### Configuration data

The last thing that is important is where to load the actual configuration from.
In Puppet world, [Hiera][hiera] is very commonly used for this. Our Puppet
repository comes with some sane defaults for every module. These configurations'
default values are overridden depending upon which environment is that module
used for provisioning. Such is the case with Vagrant as well. The values that
override the defaults are checked in the vagrant repository. The hierarchy for
Hiera is defined in `hiera.yaml` and the configuration values that override the
defaults are available in `hiera/` directory.

#### Vagrant-aware Puppet modules

Usually, the Puppet module for setting up your project will also clone your
project to the target machine. In case of Vagrant with your project already
synced to the guest machine, this may fail. You might want to avoid the cloning
step in your Puppet module. In our Vagrant file, we added a pre-defined custom
fact (called `in_vagrant`) that can be used in your modules to be aware if you
are in Vagrant or not.

Consider this example:

<pre><code class="puppet">
if $::in_vagrant != true {
	vcsrepo { '/var/www/webapplication':
		ensure   => latest,
		owner    => 'www-data',
		group    => 'www-data',
		provider => git,
		require  => [ Package['git'] ],
		source   => 'ssh://git@github.com/yourorganization/webapplication.git',
	}
}
</code></pre>

In the above Puppet code snippet, we are making sure that we don't checkout our
repository when we are in Vagrant.

### Stay secure - use proper SSH keys

As you may be sharing some projects from host to guest, there may be some
projects where you don't need to share them from guest to host but still want to
set them up. You can just go ahead and use your Puppet modules for doing that,
but you need to set up proper accesses to clone these projects in your
virtualized environment.

**scm**: this key requires you to tell us which SCM providers are your projects
using and share the access credentials so that we can generate a new set of SSH
keys inside the virtual machine and use the API of these providers to directly
add your newly generated SSH key so that the process of setting up is fully
automated.

Other than automating the complete set up, it also adds a level of security. If
a breach happens, you have finer level of control over which set of keys to
revoke.

## Multi-Machine Setup

All this will work absolutely fine for your multiple project requirement where
you have more than one services running and working with each other.

There can be a couple of things that still can be improved:

1. Multiple projects on one machine requiring the same package but with a
   different version may lead to a situation difficult to handle.
2. Multiple services running on the same port may become difficult to deal with.
   You can solve this using another proxy in between but this may not be ideal
   as this is not the way you may be doing this in production.
3. If you have services that are accessed using proxy and the upstream service
   lives on another machine, well it may be better if it was actually running on
   a different machine.

You can achieve all this using [Vagrant's Multi-Machine][multi-machine], perhaps
more than this.

As I mentioned earlier in this post, we use `mysql-proxy` to connect to the main
MySQL server, we can leverage Vagrant's multi machine feature to have two
virtual machines on the same private network and make sure that MySQL is
actually running on a different machine.

For our example, we can arrange our services like so:

    VM1:
        - webapplication
        - analytics-service
        - mysql-proxy
    VM2:
        - website
        - mysql

In the above set up, we have two virtual machines. VM1 has `webapplication` and
`analytics-service` running, both of which depend on MySQL. So they make use of
`mysql-proxy` to connect to MySQL.

On VM2, we run MySQL. So the `mysql-proxy` on VM1 proxies to VM2. We also
decided to put the `website` on VM2 for two reasons - one that this VM will
probably be under-provisioned with just MySQL running on it and two that the
webapplication runs behind Apache on port 80 but the website is served using
Nginx on port 80 and both cannot run on the same machine without putting another
proxy in front of them.

This way we have managed to make all services come as close to production set up
as possible.

## Conclusion

1. Using Vagrant and changing it a bit to our needs really helped us have the
   most critical services set up with ease. Having most of the services set up
   locally also makes it possible for end-to-end testing.
2. **Packaging the VMs** into Vagrant boxes helps reduce set up time a lot.
   Otherwise, first run may take really long to complete.
3. Development environment is much closer to production environments. We see
   relatively lesser environment specific bugs.
4. Developers have a better understanding of production systems. May be some day
   the will be able to contribute to Puppet code base as well.

Do you think these wins are worth the effort? Do share your thoughts.
